                            Microsoft Office, or simply Office, is a family of client software, server software, and services developed by Microsoft. It was first announced by Bill Gates on August 1, 1988, at COMDEX in Las Vegas. Initially a marketing term for an office suite (bundled set of productivity applications), the first version of Office contained Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint. Over the years, Office applications have grown substantially closer with shared features such as a common spell checker, Object Linking and Embedding data integration and Visual Basic for Applications scripting language. Microsoft also positions Office as a development platform for line-of-business software under the Office Business Applications brand.

It contains a word processor (Word), a spreadsheet program (Excel) and a presentation program (PowerPoint), an email client (Outlook), a database management system (Access), and a desktop publishing app (Publisher).[15]

Office is produced in several versions targeted towards different end-users and computing environments. The original, and most widely used version, is the desktop version, available for PCs running the Windows and macOS operating systems. Microsoft also maintains mobile apps for Android and iOS. Office on the web is a version of the software that runs within a web browser.

Since Office 2013, Microsoft has promoted Office 365 as the
 primary means of obtaining Microsoft Office: it allows the 
 use of the software and other services on a subscription
  business model, and users receive feature updates to the
   software for the lifetime of the subscription, including 
   new features and cloud computing integration that are not
    necessarily included in the "on-premises" releases of 
    Office sold under conventional license terms. In 2017,
    revenue from Office 365 overtook conventional license 
    sales. Microsoft also rebranded most of their standard
    Office 365 editions as "Microsoft 365" to reflect their 
    inclusion of features and services beyond the core 
    Microsoft Office suite.

In October 2022, Microsoft announced that it was to phase out
 the Microsoft Office brand in favor of "Microsoft 365" by 
 January 2023, the name continuing to be used for legacy
  product offerings.[16][17] However, Microsoft reversed
   this stance with the release of an Office 2024 preview
    build in November 2023.[18][19]. Source: Wiki

                             creating and managing databases. A DBMS makes it
                              possible for end users to create, protect, read, 
                              update and delete data in a database. The most 
                              prevalent type of data management platform, the DBMS 
                              essentially serves as an interface between databases 
                              and users or application programs, ensuring that
                               data is consistently organized and remains easily
                                accessible.The DBMS manages the data; the database engine 
                                allows data to be accessed, locked and modified; and the 
                                database schema defines the database's logical structure. 
                                These three foundational elements help provide concurrency, security, data integrity and uniform data administration procedures. The DBMS supports many typical database administration tasks, including change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, and backup and recovery. Most database management systems are also responsible for automated rollbacks and restarts as well as logging and auditing of activity in databases and the applications that access them.
